"""Decision metrics for a mule-risk score.

You write this file. Keep the signatures exactly as they are: the grader calls them by name.

Rules for every function:
- y_true and scores are lists or 1-D arrays. Raise ValueError if the lengths differ, the
  input is empty, a label is not 0 or 1, or a score is NaN.
- A case is flagged when score >= threshold.
- Precision is 0.0 when nothing is flagged; recall is 0.0 when there are no positives.
